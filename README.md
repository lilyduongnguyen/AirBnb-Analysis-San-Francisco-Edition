# San Francisco Airbnb Analysis

This project analyzes Airbnb data in San Francisco, focusing on different neighborhoods, room types, superhosts, and reviews. It includes visualizations such as maps, scatter plots, and word clouds to explore various aspects of the data.

## Installation

To run this analysis, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- geopandas
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
- folium

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install geopandas nltk pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib wordcloud folium
```

## Data

This analysis uses two dataset files:

- `listings.csv.gz`: Contains information about Airbnb listings in San Francisco, including property type, price, availability, review scores, and more.
- `reviews.csv.gz`: Contains reviews for the listings, including comments and ratings.

Please ensure that these files are placed in the project directory before running the code.

## Analysis

The analysis consists of the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries and dataset files.
2. Observing the dataset by printing information about the listings dataframe.
3. Analyzing different neighborhoods in San Francisco based on average rating, price, availability, and demand.
4. Exploring amenities across different room types and creating visualizations.
5. Analyzing superhosts and their ratings.
6. Creating word clouds to visualize high and low rating reviews.
7. Creating interactive maps using Folium to visualize the data geographically.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the following aspects:

- Average rating, price, availability, and demand across different neighborhoods in San Francisco.
- Distribution of amenities among different room types.
- Relationship between superhost status, review ratings, and host response rates.
- Word clouds showing important words in high and low rating reviews.
- Interactive maps displaying the spatial distribution of ratings, prices, and other variables across San Francisco neighborhoods.

The generated visualizations help in understanding the Airbnb landscape in San Francisco and provide valuable insights for hosts and travelers.
