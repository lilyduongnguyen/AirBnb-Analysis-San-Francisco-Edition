This README provides a guide for new hosts looking to invest in Airbnb units in San Francisco. It includes insights from the dataset and offers recommendations on location, amenities, becoming a Superhost, and improving guest experience based on reviews.

## About Airbnb

AirBnb, founded in 2008, is a global platform that connects hosts and guests for unique travel experiences. As of September 2021, the website boasts over 4 million hosts and operates in more than 220 countries and regions. In 2019, hosts in the United States alone earned over $10 billion. Airbnb also offers a Host Guarantee program, providing up to $1 million in property damage protection for eligible bookings.

## Project Summary

My analysis leverages the datasets with information about Airbnb listings in San Francisco. Here are a few key findings from my exploratory data analysis (EDA):

- Location: Guests prioritize safe neighborhoods near popular tourist attractions and public transportation.
- Average rating and price by location: Central to western regions tend to have better overall ratings and reasonable price ranges for guests.
- Demand and availability: Neighborhoods like Presidio, Seacliff, Outer Richmond, Outer Sunset, and Diamond Heights are desirable, but availability should be considered. Seacliff, Outer Richmond, and Outer Sunset have lower availability, making them better options.
- Amenities: Guests value amenities such as WiFi, TV, hangers, hair dryer, and fully equipped kitchens in entire home/apartment listings. Shared rooms have similar amenities, while private rooms often exclude kitchens. Hotel guests prioritize elevators and gyms.
- Superhosts enjoy more visibility, receive a $100 coupon annually, and can earn up to 20% on top of the usual referral bonus.

To provide exceptional guest experiences and improve your listing:

- Maintain high overall ratings across accuracy, check-ins, cleanliness, communication, location, and value.
- Strive for a response rate exceeding 90% and keep cancellations minimal.
- Analyze guest reviews to understand what aspects guests appreciate and areas that need improvement.
- Focus on cleanliness, comfort, welcoming behavior, and meeting guests' expectations.
- Understand the pros and cons of different listings and prioritize the strengths while addressing any shortcomings.

## Datasets Source
The datasets used in this project were obtained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). Inside Airbnb provides publicly available data related to Airbnb listings in various cities worldwide.

I have used two datasets "listings.csv.gz" and "reviews.csv.gz" from this website for the San Francisco area.

Please note that the dataset files are compressed in the gzip format (.gz), and you may need to extract them before using them in your analysis.
